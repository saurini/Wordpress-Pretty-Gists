Requires at least: 3.2  
Tested up to: 3.4.2  
Stable tag: 1.0  

Gives you the ability to add Github Gists to your site decorated with line numbes and alternating line color.

Description
-----------

It's simple enough to embed a Gist, but the default embedded Gist behavior isn't as easy to read as it could be. I've added line numbers and alternating line colors in order to give the gist maximum readability.

Use
---

* You can use the shortcode *[rs_gist id="**gist_id**"]* to embed the pretty gist directly into a post
* You can change the default colors of the Gist decorations by going to Settings > Pretty Gists.

Installation
------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
